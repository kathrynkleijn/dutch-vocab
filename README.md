# Dutch Vocabulary Lessons 0.2.1


Package to aid in learning Dutch vocabulary using a mixture of words and sentences for context. The lessons are based on the
Routledge Frequency Dictionary of Dutch (Carole Tiberius, Tanneke Schoonheim, <i>A Frequency Dictionary of Dutch</i>, Routledge: 2013).

The lessons are split into different topics, with a number of lessons available in the topic, each with 15 questions. For each lesson,
the number of desired questions is chosen, and a random selection of Dutch and English phrases are given for translation.

Reports of the lessons taken with charts are output if desired. 

This is designed for English speakers learning Dutch, and as such will ignore typos in English answers, but requires full accuracy for the
Dutch. Alternative English translations are accepted in some instances.
